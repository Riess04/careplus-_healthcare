<!-- [KEY QUESTIONS]

### why does the onSubmit function need to be an async function during API calls?

When communicating with external systems such as API'S and databases, async is JavaScript's way of handling operations that take time without freezing the user interface.Still keeping things fast and responsive for the user.

### Purpose of Try/catch??

Error Handling(network failures,server crashes,dtb downtime); ensures the app can continue running - upon recovery - without resulting in a crash even when external systems fail, and users get helpful feedback instead of technical error messages.

### Purpose of process.env??

Stores environment-specific configurations; configurations referring to values set outside code and vary by environment.

<!-- [NEW LEARNT KEY CONCEPTS]

- Appwrite?? :

  Baas platform that provides a complete backend (database, auth, storage, messaging, APIs) out of the box, so apps can be built faster without worrying about backend infrastructure.

- React Hook Form??

- Typescript interfaces,enums.??

ENUMS : Enums allow a developer to define a set of named constants, making it easier to create a set of distinct cases. They work best in a closed set of known values that won't change frequently, and when values are referenced across multiple files.

INTERFACE : Useful for defining object shapes and contracts(agreements about the shape and behavior of data)

Key differences ?? Enums represent a set of fixed values, interfaces represent a structure that can be extended and merged. -->
